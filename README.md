Crime Hotspot Analysis

A data analytics project that identifies and visualizes crime-prone regions using clustering techniques.

🔍 Overview

This project leverages Python, DBSCAN clustering, and geospatial data visualization to detect crime hotspots in a given city or region. It aims to assist law enforcement agencies and urban planners in understanding spatial crime patterns and optimizing resource allocation.

🧩 Key Features

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on crime datasets (latitude, longitude, type, and time).

Applied DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering) to identify crime clusters and noise points.

Visualized hotspots using Matplotlib and Seaborn with clear geographical mapping.

Generated a summary report showing cluster counts and incident distribution.

Enhanced interpretability with labeled clusters (e.g., Cluster: Theft, Cluster: Assault).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, CSV crime datasets

📊 Results

Identified key high-crime zones using unsupervised learning.

Enabled data-driven visualization of crime trends for better policy decisions.
